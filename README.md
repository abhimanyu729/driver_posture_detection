The proposed solution consists of an ensemble of convolutional neural networks. There are two different convolutional neural networks that are trained on raw images, and skin-segmented images. Initially, on those two image sources, we then train three different networks an AlexNet, an InceptionV3, and a ResNet. After evaluating their performance, it was found that the InceptionV3 network achieved the highest accuracy on the validation dataset. So, we decided to perform all further steps (like hyperparameter tuning, test, and validation) using the InceptionV3 network only. We then perform hyperparameter tuning on a pretrained InceptionV3 model. Lastly, we evaluate a weighted sum of all networks’ outputs yielding the final class distribution using a weighted majority algorithm.
Skin Segmentation: As mentioned above one of our input image sources consists of skin-segmented images, skin region detection is the process of separation between the skin and the non-skin pixels. It is difficult to develop a uniform method for the segmentation or detection of human skin detection due to multiple factors like the colour tone of human skin is drastically varied for people from one region to another, and also the lighting conditions vary drastically happening during driving with respect to the time of the day location and the interior of the car. So, we know that skin segmentation is a fairly challenging problem to solve, in order to solve this problem, we take an approach of converting Images into YCbCr colour spaces for performing skin segmentation.
A color space is a mathematical model that is used to represent color information using three or four different color components. There are a variety of color space is available for skin detection like RGB based color space (RGB, normalized RGB), Hue Based color space (HSI, HSV, and HSL), Luminance based color space (YCBCr, YIQ, and YUV), and perceptually uniform color space (CIEXYZ, CIELAB, and CIELUV). We have decided to choose the perceptually uniform color space YCbCr due to the performance and robustness of this method. This is purely based on the threshold value of three different components. When we transform an RGB color image into a YCbCr color image, the resultant image consists of an intensity component (Y) and two different chrominance components (Cb and Cr). For this project, selected threshold values for different components are Y > 0 && Y< 240 && Cr > 127 && Cr < 150 && Cb > 77 && Cb < 120. The results of the skin segmentation algorithm.
Convolutional Neural Network: For the purpose of this project we trained and tested three different neural network architectures: an AlexNet, an InceptionV3, and a ResNet network having 50 layers. Each network is trained on 2 different image sources (i.e., raw, skin-segmented images). We used pretrained models for all the networks AlexNet, ResNet and InceptionV3, i.e. we performed transfer learning. Then we fine-tuned on the pretrained InceptionV3 model on the distraction postures. Next for them to perform well on the task of distracted driver posture classification we removed the last few layers from each of these models and finally replaced them with a Flatten layer, a Dropout layer and three fully connected layers in the end. For all our models, we used the adam optimizer with an initial learning rate of 10−2. As we know that Adam is an adaptive learning rate optimization algorithm it changes the learning rate decays in each epoch. We then trained each of the networks for 40 epochs. Next, we will divide the training dataset into batches of 32 images each in every epoch.
Ensemble of Classifiers: The output of the softmax layers (i.e. the final layer) of each classifier produces a class probability vector, C1…CN, such that 𝐶𝑖 ∈ R10 is a vector having 10 probabilities (for 10 distraction classes) where N is equal to the number of classifiers. So, if we consider a simple majority voting system that assumes that all classifiers are equal contributors to the decision, so it calculates an unweighted sum of all classifier outputs.
However, if we try to have a closer look at it this might not seem to be a valid assumption. So, we decided to choose a weighted voting system, where we assume that classifiers do not contribute equally to the ensemble and that some classifiers might yield higher accuracy than others.
