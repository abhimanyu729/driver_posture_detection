# driver_posture_detection
Classifying the postures of a driver using a Genetically weighted ensemble of Inception V3 networks(Transfer learning). Applied Image Augmentation, and ensemble learning to reduce overfitting also converted the original dataset of RGB colored images to YCbCr color space for skin segmentation. Then using the model developed a system to predict the postures from an input video stream stored in Cassandra Database.
